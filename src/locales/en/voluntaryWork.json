    "tasks": "I worked on data extraction, cleaning, and analysis, including sociodemographic sampling and the development of reports and dashboards to disseminate results, generating valuable insights to inform public policy and foster inclusion.",
    "intro": "Volunteering at MAB has been one of the most meaningful experiences of my journey so far. Unlike conventional projects, this initiative has a strong social purpose, focused on inclusion and on building public policies based on real data about the autistic population in Brazil. I joined as a data analyst, but soon realized my role went beyond numbers: it was about turning data into dignity, visibility, and rights.",
    "mission": "Map the sociodemographic and clinical profile of autistic people across Brazil, providing essential data to inform public policies, expand access to services, and secure rights.",
    "methodology": "The research was conducted 100% online, with non-probability convenience sampling. Approved by the University of Brasília Ethics Committee (CAAE: 85422624.9.0000.5540).",
    "participants": "Adult autistics (18+) with a medical diagnosis and caregivers of autistic minors or adults who cannot respond on their own participated.",
    "questionnaire": "The online form (SurveyMonkey) does not request sensitive data and covers: sociodemographic profile, diagnosis, education, therapies, and medical follow-up.",
    "results": "Results will be published on the MAB website and will contribute to public policies, service strategies, and improved access to rights for the autistic community.",
